1. Project Overview
The Smart Inventory Management System is a modern software solution aimed at
optimizing and automating the management of inventory for businesses. It is particularly
tailored for small to medium-sized enterprises seeking to reduce stock discrepancies,
streamline supply chain operations, and improve decision-making through accurate and realtime inventory tracking.
This system will be developed using Advanced Java, leveraging the power of Spring Boot
and Spring Framework to create a secure, modular, and scalable backend architecture. The
application will provide a RESTful API for integration with front-end interfaces or thirdparty systems, ensuring flexibility and extensibility.
2. Implementation Technology
The system will be developed using the following technologies and tools:
• Advanced Java (JDK 17 or higher)
• Spring Boot – For building stand-alone, production-grade applications
• Spring Framework – For dependency injection and modular structure
• Spring Security – For role-based access control and secure authentication using JWT
• Spring Data JPA + Hibernate – For ORM and database interaction
• MySQL / PostgreSQL – For data persistence
• Maven / Gradle – For project build and dependency management
• RESTful APIs – For system integration and communication
• Postman – For API testing
3. Project Objectives
• To design a centralized inventory management platform.
• To provide secure, role-based access for staff and administrators.
• To ensure real-time stock tracking and reduce manual errors.
• To streamline the supplier and order handling processes.
• To expose a clean API for system integrations (e.g., with POS systems).
• To enable business intelligence through dynamic reporting.
• To build a system that is scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly.
4. Functional Requirements
1. User Management
• Register, login, logout functionality.
• Role-based access: Admin and Staff.
• Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
2. Product Management
• Add, edit, delete, and view products.
• Support for categories and tags.
• Real-time search and filtering.
3. Inventory Tracking
• Automatic stock updates on product inflow/outflow.
• Alerts for low stock levels or overstock.
• Real-time quantity dashboard.
4. Supplier Management
• Add and manage supplier records.
• Associate suppliers with specific products.
• View supplier transaction history.
5. Order Management
• Create, update, and manage purchase/sales orders.
• Generate invoices and receipts.
• Track order status (Pending, Completed, Cancelled).
6. Reporting and Analytics
• View and export reports (sales, purchases, stock levels).
• Filter reports by date, product, or supplier.
• Export to PDF/Excel.
7. API Access
• REST API with endpoints for all modules.
• Protected using Spring Security and JWT.
• Swagger documentation for testing and collaboration.
8. Security
• Input validation and error handling.
• Secure API endpoints.
• Encrypted password storage using Crypt.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
• Performance: System should respond within 2 seconds for most requests.
• Scalability: Easily deployable to cloud and scalable for increasing data volume.
• Maintainability: Modular codebase with layered architecture (Controller, Service,
Repository).
• Reliability: Data integrity ensured through ACID-compliant transactions.
• Usability: Simple, intuitive interfaces and API structure.
• Security: HTTPS support, secure tokens, and controlled data access.
6. Development Methodology
The development process will follow the Agile methodology, involving:
• Sprint-based planning and iteration.
• Regular stakeholder feedback and demos.
• Version control and CI/CD practices.
• Unit and integration testing using JUnit and Spring Test.
7. Conclusion
This documentation serves as a foundational blueprint for the design and development of the Smart
Inventory Management System. The use of Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Spring Data JPA
ensures modern development standards, while the modular and layered architecture supports
maintainability and scalability. This document will serve as a key reference for both technical and
non-technical stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of the project.
